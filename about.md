### About Bryan!

Iâ€™m an experienced and versatile data scientist with proven strength in communication and engineering cloud forward machine learning solutions.

I have a strong background in R and Python. My focus as a Machine Learning Engineer is to understand client needs and develop long term, scalable, cloud-based ML solutions hosted on a platform that is most native to the client. I have development experience in both AWS and Azure environments.

My personal interests include cooking, craft beer, weightlifting (see first two), and traveling.
